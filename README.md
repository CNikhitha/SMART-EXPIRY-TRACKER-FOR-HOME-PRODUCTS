# SMART-EXPIRY-TRACKER-FOR-HOME-PRODUCTS
Smart Expiry Tracker for Home Products is a team project developed by a group of two members. The project helps users to track expiry dates of household items such as food, medicines, cosmetics and other daily-use products. It aims to reduce waste and ensure safety by providing timely reminders before products expire.
